# üåü Image Authentication Microservices üåü

This project is build because I wanted to learn more about Kubernetes and how the services work.
I also wanted to learn more about Microservices. 
For future references I can use this project to go further into communicating components.
Like rabbitMQ.

---

## Creating the microservices üí≠

First I created an authentication service. Here you can do the following:

* Register a user.

![postman_image_register][imagePostmanApiRegisterUser]
    
* Login a user.

![postman_image_login][imagePostmanApiLoginUser]

When you log in with a registered user, you get a JSON token for authentication with other services.
The image service uses this JSON token to authenticate if the user can use this service.

![postman_image][imagePostmanApiPOSTimage]
## Creating the database üîê

First I created the database to store the images. I wanted to create the database and service inside my Kubernetes Cluster.
I connected a SSD drive to the cluster for storage purpose, and I used this guide to know how to store items on it.
Then I created the configmap. This is where I stored the password, username and the database-name. Location of üîó[database YAML files][locationRepoDatabaseDeployment].

1. Connected SSD to the server. Used this üîó[guide][websiteAddingSSDRaspberryPI] to figure out how to connect to it and where it is stored.
2. Created configmap - for storing user data for connecting to the database. Here I used documentation from üîó[Rancher][websiteCreatingVolumeK3s].
3. Created the storage - This part is most important because this is where I specify where to store the files. ![hostImagePath][imageStorageLocationDatabase] 
4. Created the deployment -  This is the pod. When something goes wrong with the database this is the thing that replicates and restarts the services. 
5. Created the service - This is for exposing the pod. This is, so I can connect an outside service to it like the database local on my laptop.

## Creating the deployments ‚ö°

For deploying I created a dockerfile for each microservice. This is used for creating images. 
The images I can use on any platform I want as long as I deploy with Docker buildx.
Buildx is an experimental feature of Docker. I used the following actions:

* ‚úÖ Action for [check out][actionCheckOut]
* ‚úÖ Docker action for [QMU][actionDockerSetupQmu]
* ‚úÖ Docker action for [buildx][actionDockerSetupBuildx]
* ‚úÖ Docker action for [login][actionDockerLogin]
* ‚úÖ Docker action for [build and push][actionDockerBuildPush]
* ‚úÖ Action for pushing files to a [local kubernetes cluster][actionPushToKubernetes] 

Location for deployment files:

* üîó[authentication service][locationRepoAuthenticationDeployments]
* üîó[image service][locationRepoImageDeployments]

## Testing the deployments üèÅ

For testing an application capability's on a kubernetes cluster I searched the internet for 'How to load test an application in a kubernetes cluster.'
This is when I found [locust](https://locust.io/). This framework can be used to load test and simulate Users. 

For the first test I started with a replicaset of 2 pods, 100 users at a spawn rate of 10.

![loadUsers][imageLocustLoad]

which saw the following results:

![imageSchema2Replica][imageLocust2Replicas]

Here you can see that I get 55 Requests per second.
After this  I tried to scale up. I scaled up to a replicaset of 10.

![imageReplicaKubernetes][imageKubernetes10Replicas]

The result I got where the following.

![locustResult10Replica][imageLocust10Replicas]

With more replicasets I get more requests per second. The median response time also goes down, from 1700 to 900 ms.
